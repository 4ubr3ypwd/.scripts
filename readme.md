# scripts

My custom scripts that should be symlinked to `~/scripts`.

# xampp.php

Easy way to add a local dev environment with XAMPP.

`sudo php ~/scripts/xampp.php add mydomain.dev`

# add-db.php

Adds a database (local). Should work for most MySQL on local, but
intended for my XAMPP install.

`sudo php ~/scripts/add-db.php <databasename>`

# set-screenshots.sh

`sh ~/scripts/set-screenshots.sh`

Sets the screenshots folder to `~/Downloads`.

# downloads-clean.sh

`sh ~/scripts/downloads-clean.sh`

Cleans out the `~/Downloads` folder.

# dnsflush.php

`sh ~/scripts/dnsflush.sh`

Flushes the DNS cache.

# DS_Store-clean.sh

`sh ~/scripts/DS_Store-clean.sh`

Cleans your system of these damn things but keeps the one that makes our
window stay the same.
